# Credit Risk Prediction using ML

## Project Overview:

**Project Goal**: To develop a data-driven model that predicts credit risk with high accuracy, assisting lenders in making informed loan decisions, optimizing risk management strategies, and ultimately reducing bad debt ratios and improving overall portfolio quality.

**Motivation**:

- **Financial stability**: Accurate credit risk prediction helps lenders avoid bad loans, ensuring financial stability and responsible lending practices.
- **Improved borrower experience**: By identifying borrowers with lower risk, lenders can offer more favorable loan terms and improve the overall borrower experience.
- **Data-driven insights**: This project leverages the power of data to uncover patterns and relationships in creditworthiness, leading to better decision-making and risk management.

**Note**: This project was developed as part of my academic practice to enhance my skills in Data Analysis and Machine Learning application in the financial domain.
