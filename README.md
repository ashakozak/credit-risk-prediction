# Credit Risk Prediction using ML

## Project Overview:

**Project Goal**: To develop a data-driven model that predicts credit risk with high accuracy, assisting lenders in making informed loan decisions, optimizing risk management strategies, and ultimately reducing bad debt ratios and improving overall portfolio quality.

**Motivation**:

- **Financial stability**: Accurate credit risk prediction helps lenders avoid bad loans, ensuring financial stability and responsible lending practices.
- **Improved borrower experience**: By identifying borrowers with lower risk, lenders can offer more favorable loan terms and improve the overall borrower experience.
- **Data-driven insights**: This project leverages the power of data to uncover patterns and relationships in creditworthiness, leading to better decision-making and risk management.

**Note**: This project was developed as part of my academic practice to enhance my skills in Data Analysis and Machine Learning application in the financial domain.

## Dataset:

- **Dataset source**: [Credit Risk Dataset by Lao Tse](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset) on Kaggle (CSV file with 32,581 individual loan transactions).
  
- **Data fields**:
  1. **Borrower Demographics**:
     - `/person_age/`: Age of the borrower </br>
     Younger borrowers may have less established credit history and financial stability, potentially increasing risk. Older borrowers may have more stable incomes and assets, potentially decreasing risk.
     - `/person_income/`: Annual Income of the borrower </br>
    Higher income indicates greater financial capacity to repay loans, potentially decreasing risk. Lower income may raise concerns about affordability, potentially increasing risk.
     - `/person_home_ownership/`: Whether the borrower owns their own home </br>
    Homeowners may have more assets and stability, potentially decreasing risk. Renters may have less financial security, potentially increasing risk.
     - `/person_emp_length/`: Employment length in years </br>
    Longer employment history may indicate job security and income stability, potentially decreasing risk. Frequent job changes or short employment periods may raise concerns, potentially increasing risk.
       
  2. **Loan Details**:
     - `/loan_intent/`: Purpose of the loan. </br>
       Types of loan_intent: 
       - Debt consolidation:	↑ May indicate accumulated debt and financial strain.
       - Education:	↓ Invests in future earning potential, potentially lowering risk.
       - Home Improvement:	↓ Suggests stability and responsibility..
       - Medical:	↑ Unpredictable expenses and burden, potentially increasing risk. 
       - Personal: Varies depending on purpose. Major purchases might be less risky than discretionary spending.
       - Venture:	↑ High risk due to business uncertainty. 
     - `/loan_grade/`: Creditworthiness rating assigned by the lender - 
     - `/loan_amnt/`:
     - `/loan_int_rate/`:
     - `/loan_status/`:
     - `/loan_percent_income/`:
     - `/cb_person_default_on_file/`:
     - `/cb_preson_cred_hist_length/`:
